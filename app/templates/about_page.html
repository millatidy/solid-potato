    <h1 class="display-4">Hello!</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        This web application was developed by Milla Mutiwokuziva as part of a Britecore's Remote Engineering job application process.
    </p>
    <p class="h2">The Tech</p>
    <p>
        As per requirements, this project's backend is developed in python using Flask as the web Framework of choice. The frontend is developed with HTML, CSS(Bootstrap 4), and JS(JQuery for RESTAPI calls, and a bit of rendering and Knockout.js for data handling).
        This web app is deployed on an AWS EC2 t2.mirco instance, running Unbuntu 18.04, therefore Elasticsearch is disabled due to memory limitations. The web app sits in a docker container behind a Gunicorn WSGI Server which sits behind an Nginx reverse proxy server. Database of choice
        is PostgreSQL also running on AWS. Errors are logged by a Raven from Sentry and are logged on the sentry website.
    </p>
    <p class="h2">The Features</p>
    <p>
        Besides what is required by Britecore team the only extra additional feature at this point is the ability to search Features in the application. One basic requrement of a web app that has not been implemented is the security aspect all due to time contraints
        and the fear of missing the submission deadline. This whole app is meant to demonstrate my capability and potential.
    </p>
    <p>
        Backend tests have been done and coverage can be found <a href="https://github.com/millatidy/solid-potato/tree/master/tmp/coverage">here</a>, as for front end tests a whole lot of console log statements were written but I do have plans to learn frontend
        testing frameworks in the near future. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I hope my <a href="https://github.com/millatidy">repository</a>, my idle <a href="https://www.workshift.co.zw">side project</a> and <a href="https://github.com/millatidy/solid-potato">this</a> webapp paint a clear picture of my capability, my potential
        and that <code>this.guy()</code> is very employable.
    </p>
